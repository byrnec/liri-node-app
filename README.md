# LIRI-node-app

## Created by Christie Byrne

LIRI, the command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

 ## LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

## Purpose of the game
To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial.


This will retrieve and manipulate the information entered with Moment.js. 

At the bottom, this website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
## Notes

The .env file will be used by the dotenv package to set what are known as environment variables to the global process.env object in node. These are values that are meant to be specific to the computer that node is running on, and since we are gitignoring this file, they won't be pushed to github â€” keeping our API key information private.
